title: About Me
---
I am **Paul Justin M. Balaoro**, an undergraduate student of BS Architecture in the Polytechnic University of the Philippines.

## Précis of my perspective

Rooting from the passion for arts, I continuously appreciate the world of creativity and imagination. I am ironically engaging into a science-related study wherein the hopes and persistence on becoming a professional under a branch of arts—the architecture seems possible. As a Filipino, I aim to develop culture-based quality creations, sustainable communities through strategies and designs with the people and for the people of the nation.
