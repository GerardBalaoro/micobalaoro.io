I could have run, but no one in the room had ever taken a move. After hopes that we'll behaving our Building Materials subject not with Ar. Eric Baño, we found ourselves intently listening, daydreaming, and feeling truly subjected to great challenge.

From a light atmosphere of greetings, short stories, updates, and calling of names, tables instantly turned to the heavy weight of announced next week's requirements sinking deeply as we started to accept the fate of next days to come—ones that are not truly pleasing. Tasked to finish fifty pages of a five-stanza poem in architectural lettering, a blog of the day's orientation, brochures from raw materials trading/selling company, and seven sketches of raw materials, I felt the pressure and intense hard work that would be exerted for this. I told myself "this is too much" but anyway we'll eventually finish it. The rules were delivered as it sounds in a warning manner. The words of wisdom we’re something that might have implicitly stated 'you chose to do this; might as well we'll push you harder to reach your dream'. The fact that we already have accepted we are not good in everything, somehow bent down as it might have warned that we should keep trying to be comprehensively excellent in all aspects of architecture.

I told myself as I have pondered in a short while, 'this could be unhealthy, could not we just take a moment to gradually come to that point, could not we go to transition from easy to difficult load? It really is negatively overwhelming, but maybe this one is the easiest in his standard, he might have just been preparing us for a much harder load than this which we are startled to take. I find it harder to think, and might as well that I shall recall and hold on to the biggest motivations I have in order to be not submersed into the pressure, though that could also be the way to help ourselves just not to drown.
